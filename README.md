# HGT
Here we describe in detail 
1. Calculation of exact matches between genomic sequences:

To find all matches longer than 300bp between sequences in files 1.fa and 2.fa and save it in the file Res.mumm we use the following command: mummer -maxmatch -n -b -l 300 1.fa 2.fa > Res.mumm.

2. Making histogram of matches lengths
3. Calculation the prefactor of the resulting power-law.
4. Calculation of the GO and SEED terms enrichment.
